# Facial Emotion Detection using CNN üé≠üß†

This project implements a real-time facial emotion recognition system using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the FER-2013 dataset. The system detects facial expressions from a live webcam stream and classifies them into five categories: **Angry**, **Happy**, **Neutral**, **Sad**, and **Surprise**.
